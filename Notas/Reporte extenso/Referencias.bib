	abstract = {The sphere is what might be called a perfect shape. Unfortunately nature is imperfect and many bodies are better represented by an ellipsoid. The theory of ellipsoidal harmonics, originated in the nineteenth century, could only be seriously applied with the kind of computational power available in recent years. This, therefore, is the first book devoted to ellipsoidal harmonics. Topics are drawn from geometry, physics, biosciences and inverse problems. It contains classical results as well as new material, including ellipsoidal bi-harmonic functions, the theory of images in ellipsoidal geometry and vector surface ellipsoidal harmonics, which exhibit an interesting analytical structure. Extended appendices provide everything one needs to solve formally boundary value problems. End-of-chapter problems complement the theory and test the reader's understanding. The book serves as a comprehensive reference for applied mathematicians, physicists, engineers and for anyone who needs to know the current state of the art in this fascinating subject.},

However, many surveying and geodetic problems could be resolved by simply transforming variables between local frames. Herein it is shown that the computations of local displacements and variance-covariance matrices referred to currently used local curvilinear geodetic coordinate frames gives approximately the same answers than when referred to local ellipsoidal (triaxial) curvilinear frames. The theoretical procedures to obtain the required transformations between local geodetic and local ellipsoidal (triaxial) frames are introduced and examples explained.},
